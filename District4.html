                    The Galicayo Festival is a province-wide cultural and religious celebration
                    in honor of Pangasinan’s patroness, Our Lady of Manaoag.
                     Back in the late 1500's, an apparition of the Virgin Mary was believed tocall on the people to build a church. The term
                    manaoag, which means "tocall", was then attributed to the town and eventually became its officialname. The Dominicans viewed the appearance of the apparition as amiraculous event and they were inspired to build the church of Our Lady of Manaoag. The church's foundation, coupled with the story behind it, madeManaoag the religios center of Pangasinan.The people of Manaoag decided to hold a feast in honor of their patronsaint, which was named as the Galicayo Festival</p>
