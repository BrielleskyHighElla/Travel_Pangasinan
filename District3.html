                    The town of Calasiao, aside from being famous for its miraculous shrine of 
                    Señor Divino Tesoro is also touted as the center of “Best Puto” in the
                    country.
                    It was under Mayor Roy Macanlalay in cooperation with the town’s puto
                    makers that the first Calasiao Puto Festival was held on Dec. 28, 2002.
                    Puto here is considered as the “white gold” of the town and sold 24 hours a
                    day along the rows of stalls at the town proper . It is so delicious becausethis peso-size product is soft as a marshmallow, white as a snow, and hasa distinct taste and the secrets of cooking it remain unrevealed up to nowby its makers.The event has encouraged Pangasinenses and those living outside topatronize locally made products</p>
